# SI 506: Problem Set 10


You will use `problem_set_10.py` to complete the assignment. You can retrieve it from Canvas Files or the Github [SI506-2019Fall](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall) repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_10.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recorded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of this problem set is different than what you may be used to. In this problem set, you
will be asked to produce a number of functions. Each of these functions has been initialized for you with the
stub of a definition statement. You will need to fill in the correct parameters, code, and if necessary, return
statements for each function. You will also be responsible for creating tests (outside of the few that have
been provided for you) that will ensure that your code will run correctly.

NOTE: The autograder may take a minute or more to run on this assignment. As such, it may be best to do lots of
local testing to make sure your code is doing what you want it to do instead of waiting for the autograder to
tell you each time!
