# SI 506: Lab Exercise 12

This week's lab exercise includes three (3) problems that focuses on list 
and dictionary comprehensions. Retrieve `lab_exercise_12.py` from Canvas Files or the Github 
[SI506-2019Fall](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall) repo.

When you have completed the lab click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`lab_exercise_12.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any 
runtime errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 lab exercise resembles the following:

```python

# START LAB EXERCISE X

print('LAB EXERCISE X \n')

# PROBLEM 1 (25 points)

# Instructions for problem 1 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION

# Write your problem 1 solution between the BEGIN/END comments.

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '')
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values
# to the screen.

# END PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION

# START PROBLEM 2 SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between

# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 2 (25 points)

# Instructions for problem 2 provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Write your 02 solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . .

# END PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Additional problems may follow, structured similarly to problems 1 and 2 above.

# END LAB EXERCISE
```
