# SI 506: Lab Exercise 03

This week's lab exercise includes three (3) problems that focus on creating lists, accessing and manipulating
list items, and iterating over a list using a `for` loop.

You will use `lab_exercise_03.py` to complete the assignment. You can retrieve the file from Canvas or from the 
Github [SI506-2019Fall](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall) repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
'lab_exercise_03.py' file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 lab exercise resembles the following:

```python
# START LAB EXERCISE X
print('LAB EXERCISE X \n')

# PROBLEM 1
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION

# Write your problem 1 solution between the BEGIN/END comments. 

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be 
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '') 
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally 
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values 
# to the screen.

# END PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION


# START PROBLEM 2 SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use 
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between
# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 2
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Write your 01B solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . . 

# END PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

# Additional problems may follow, structured similarly to problems 1 and 2 above.

# END LAB EXERCISE
```
